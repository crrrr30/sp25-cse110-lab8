**Paragraph:** How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

*Response.* First, the use of service workers to intercept and cache `fetch()`'es ensures that important data can be presented on the website even when web connectivity is down. Further, even if service workers are not available, the app can still function without the caching functionality. In both aspects, the integration of service workers, used in the above manner, exemplifies the principle of graceful degradation.
